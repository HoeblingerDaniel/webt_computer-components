            <h3>CPU:</h3>
            <p>
                Gets the commands from the RAM and decodes it with the control unit.
                The CPU also has a ALU and with it you can calculate things.
                The smallest storage in a computer is the Cache. It is located in the CPU and is really small.
                There are 3 types of the caches the L1, L2 and L3 cache. They first cache is the smallest but the fastest and so on.
                The CPUs nowadays have more than only one core. So they can do more than one task at once.

            <h3>Motherboard:</h3>
            <p>
                The motherboard has the printed circuit board on it.
                It is a multi-layer board. And on each layer it has it´s traces.
                And the traces are for the communication of all components.
                The mainboard also controls the Bios/UEFI. The Bios/UEFI is important for starting the Computer.
                It loads your config every start.
                The difference between the Bios and the UEFI is, that the UEFI has a graphic interface and the BIOS not.

            <h3>RAM:</h3>
            <p>
                As we mentioned before the RAM is a really fast storage.
                It is 250 times quicker than a normal HDD.
                The RAM is called random-access memory. It is called random because wherever you want to get the address it will always last the same.
                On the HDD it won´t last the same time. In the RAM are the commands for the CPU.
                You can´t save your files on the RAM or something. This is why there is the HDD or the SSD.
