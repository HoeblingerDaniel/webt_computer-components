            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>
                Simply put, if you’re building a PC to play games, then the GPU will be your most important purchase.
                Other components can also impact performance, such as the CPU, storage, and RAM, but the GPU has the most direct connection to what you see on screen when playing.
                There are many different kinds of games, though, and not all of them demand the most powerful GPU on the market.
                That’s why it’s important to read a game’s required, recommended, and optimal specifications to make sure that you get a suitable GPU.

            <h3>Rendering</h3>
            <p>
                Those who use their PCs for complex tasks like 3D rendering, game development, and video editing also benefit from faster GPUs.
                Workstation GPUs are optimized for these applications, and their drivers are certified to be stable and reliable when undertaking these operations.
                Professional class graphics cards can be immensely powerful, and are often more expensive than even high-end gaming GPUs, but because they weren’t designed specifically for gaming workloads, they probably aren’t ideal for a gaming PC.
