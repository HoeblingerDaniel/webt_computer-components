                <p class="title">There are two big CPU brands Intel and AMD:</p>
                <p>
                    Intel only makes CPUs and AMD also makes graphics cards.
                    In the past AMD didn't make as good CPUs as Intel but in the last years AMD caught up with Intel.
                    Nowadays they are equally as good but each is better in different use cases.

                    So overall AMD is better for core intensive work and intel for clock speed intensive work
                    but also requires more power. Also AMD is more affordable then Intel.
