            <h3>CPU:</h3>
            <p>The CPU is the Central Processing Unit. It is the "brain" of the computer. It is very important 
                for running the programs otherwise they wouldn't work. Basically it gets commands and executes/runs
                them.

            <h3>Motherboard:</h3>
            <p>The Motherboard also called Mainboard, it connects every PC component with each other. That means
                every component is plugged in to the motherboard.

            <h3>RAM:</h3>
            <p>The RAM is a really fast but also a small storage. It is a temporary storage for the CPU.
                As we mentioned it is a small storage and the most computers have about 8gb of RAM.

            <h3>Power Supply:</h3>
            <p>The power supply is as the name says a component which gives the PC the power.
                Without it it wouldn't run because it needs of course electricity.
                Based on what computer you have the more or less watts you need.

            <img src="../../Images/hdd.png" alt="HDD" class="mostimportantimg">
            <h3>Storage:</h3>
            <p>There are two different types of storage. The first one is the HDD. It is the older
                version of storage. It is the slowest one but in case of storage space it is the larger
                one. The second one is the SSD it is way faster than the HDD. But it has not that much 
                storage space. The SSD is also more expensive than the HDD.
